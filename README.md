# Functionality

1. Real-time markdown rendering.
2. Shortcut buttons for easy editing.
    
    If users select a part of text before clicking on `Bold`, `Italic`, `Link` or `Code`, that part would be wrapped by the corresponding command.

    `Indent`, `List`, and `Code`(when nothing is selected) would create a text block right after the current paragraph.

    Generally, this feature resembles Colab text box.

3. Undo by `Ctrl+Z` or `Command+Z`.

# Implementation

`marked` module is used for Markdown content parsing and rendering. It provides a simple and flexible API and it supports a wide range of markdown syntax.

Button behavior is carefully developed based on Colab text box. The behavior of each command depends on whether the cursor has selected a part of text, and whether the current line has any text. The button callback is written in `App.js`.

The undo feature is realized by an undo stack that registers both regular user input and the value generated by buttons. Its size is set to 10 by default.

# Future Work

1. Enable redo feature;
2. Remain cursor position after pressing buttons;
3. Undo editing when some buttons are pressed twice continuously, e.g., `Bold` and `Italic`.
